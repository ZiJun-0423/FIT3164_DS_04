# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

Because it's using React + Vite, "Open in Live Server" will be a blank page.
Some of the stuffs you might need to see the website:
npm  (Check with npm -v, should be higher than 10.9.2)
node (Check with npm -v, should be higher than 18.x.x but download the latest one and it should be v22.x.x)

Then npm install
There might be some error, don't worry about it.

Then npm run dev.
